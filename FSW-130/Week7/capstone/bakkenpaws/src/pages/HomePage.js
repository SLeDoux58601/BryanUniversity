            <h3>Everybody needs a friend. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</h3>

            <p>
            I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You're meant to have fun in life. Little short strokes.

            Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. There comes a nice little fluffer. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. You gotta think like a tree.
            
            We'll make some happy little bushes here. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>
