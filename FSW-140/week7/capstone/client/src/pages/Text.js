            <p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>
            <br />
            <p>No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Let your heart be your guide. Every day I learn. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.</p>
