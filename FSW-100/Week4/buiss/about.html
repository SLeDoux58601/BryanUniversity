            <p>Originally started in 1964 as a machine shop, Diamond has always been associated with quality and precision truck equipment as a natural spin off in the 60's, since no one in the area offered this service. From frame stretching, adding axles, shortening and reinforcing boxes and hoists to custom fabrication. Our work can be seen as far away as Alaska, Quebec Canada, Connecticut and Tampa Florida. We pride ourselves on taking on the "tough" projects and making them work for the customer.

            Over the past 53 years, we have seen the farm industry go from a 13 1/2' box and hoist up to a 22' tri-axle truck or grain trailer. Diamond is proud to represent the Jet Grain Trailer, the best trailer around.
            
            Diamond offers a full repair and installation shop, offering certified steel and aluminum welding, a full paint facility and body shop facility, so if you need a complete rebuild or restoration, we can handle it. Five generations later, Diamond still stands for quality and very competitive prices. If you are in the area, stop in. We are only a 1/2 mile off of the I-94. We stock popular pieces such as dump bodies, farm bodies, tag axles, grain trailers, bale beds, gooseneck bodies, pickup accessories, truck hoists, cranes, service bodies, roll tarps, and a large selection of used equipment and trucks.
