                    <div> Experts believe bipolar disorder is partly caused by an underlying problem with specific brain circuits and the functioning of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. ... Noradrenaline and serotonin have been consistently linked to psychiatric mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder.<br>
                        A stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder.Examples of stressful triggers include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>A breakdown of a relationship</li>
                          <li>physical, sexual or emotional abuse</li>
                          <li>the death of a close family member or loved one</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>There's no sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health disorder can help prevent bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening.

                            If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression:</div>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Pay attention to warning signs.</b> Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse. You may have identified a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what triggers them. Call your doctor if you feel you're falling into an episode of depression or mania. Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs.</li>
                                <li><b>Avoid drugs and alcohol.</b>Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more likely to come back.</li>
                                <li><b>Take your medications exactly as directed.</b> You may be tempted to stop treatment â€” but don't. Stopping your medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <div> Having Bipolar Depression is not easy, it makes challenging things in life seem 10x more challenging. You have to battle yourself on a daily, even if you are medicated you still are not what they refer to as stable. When you are are
                        bipolar you do not know what it means to be "normal", however the idea of normal is in your mind and the image of what it must be often goes past your thoughts. 
                        In my personal case of batteling Bipolar disorder, Bipolar 2 Depression to be more specific I have learned to work with my diagnosis and realize how much stronger it makes me to get as far as I can with my life along with batteling this mental disorder.
                        When you have any form of mental illnesse and you get to this point of thinking " Hey I have this disorder, this mental illness, but I have it! It does not have me, it does not define who I am. " In that moment, when you start to think that way, a form of 
                        empowerment like no other starts to take over you. All I can say is, there is absolutely nothing better than that feeling of owning something that once made you feel like the most weakest and vaulnerable human being out there and developing a form of strength out of it.
                        <br> I have never learned to completely control my mood swings, or learned to understand them. However I have learned to own it, to understand it, and to grow with it. The more I have grown after finding out my diagnosis the more things have gotten better and I guess easier to 
                        deal with. I will never let Bipolar Depression define who I am, I want to Define it! I want to be one of the greats out there who also managed to be an inspiration with battling their own mind and emotions. 
                        Some of those great people were: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Carrie Fisher</li>

                    <div> Health is a major factor on how your Bipolar brain will function, poor diet, not active, and lack of sunlight. All of that can lead you into having more moodswings and more lows, it is crazy how simple little choices can make a huge difference. <br>
                    Lets start with the diet, what are the do's and dont's ? Avoiding the "Western" style diet that's rich in red meats, saturated fats and trans fats, and simple carbohydrates. This eating style is linked to a higher risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
                My psychiatrist specifically requested me to stick to a more of a hunting, gathering syle diet i.e. the Paleo diet. That diet change made a HUGE impact on my mood swings. <br>
            Up your water intake, that is a must with so much health benefits, be cautious with cafiene. with all diets make your changes slowly! never dive in fast, enjoy things you love but just be very scarce with it. Eating fish or taking in Fish oil can help keep your heart healthy. But some experts also believe that fish oil might play a role in brain function and behavior. While studies of omega-3 fatty acids for mood symptoms are not conclusive, some experts believe that they may be helpful in some people with bipolar disorder, particularly if they have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or high triglycerides. </div>

Or call a suicide hotline number â€” in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).

                        If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person.
